# Design Patterns

## What are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are reusable solutions for common software design problems. They are often used by object-oriented engineers to write more structured, manageable, and scalable code. These patterns can be chosen based on specific scenarios or problems to enhance software quality.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design Patterns are categorized into three main types:

1. **Creational Design Patterns**
2. **Structural Design Patterns**
3. **Behavioral Design Patterns**

---

### 1. Creational Design Patterns

Creational Design Patterns focus on how objects are created and problems related to object creation. These patterns make the system independent of the way objects are created, composed, and represented.

Types of Creational Design Patterns:
- **Factory Method Pattern**
- **Abstract Factory Method Pattern**
- **Singleton Pattern**
- **Prototype Pattern**
- **Builder Pattern**

---

### 2. Structural Design Patterns

Structural Design Patterns help assemble objects and classes into larger structures while maintaining their efficiency and flexibility. These patterns leverage inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.

Types of Structural Design Patterns:
- **Adapter Pattern**
- **Bridge Pattern**
- **Composite Pattern**
- **Decorator Pattern**
- **Facade Pattern**
- **Flyweight Pattern**
- **Proxy Pattern**

### 3. Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral Design Patterns are concerned with communication between objects, including how they interact and distribute responsibility. These patterns focus on algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Types of Behavioral Design Patterns:
- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
- **Command Pattern**
- **Interpreter Pattern**
- **Iterator Pattern**
- **Mediator Pattern**
- **Memento Pattern**
- **Observer Pattern**
- **State Pattern**
- **Strategy Pattern**
- **Template Method Pattern**
- **Visitor Pattern**
